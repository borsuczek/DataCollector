# DataCollector

## Description
**DataCollector** is a mobile application designed to gather data from various sensors, such as the accelerometer and gyroscope. The application enables users to collect sensor data for specific activities (e.g., standing, taking 10 steps, climbing stairs, turning 90 degrees left or right, or using the elevator) and stores it in a PostgreSQL database hosted on a server. If the server is unavailable, the data is cached locally and pushed to the server when the application is reopened and the server is accessible. Users can analyze how sensor data changes across different activities and environments using tools like PGAdmin to examine the database.
